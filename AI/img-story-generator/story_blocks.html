    <h2>📖 The Story So Far...</h2>
    <p>
        Neo City used to sparkle under the sun with towering buildings, flying cars, and cheerful people on every street. 
        But one stormy evening, a deep purple cloud rolled in. It wasn’t just bad weather — it was Darkstorm, 
        a villain with the power to erase anything he touches.<br><br>
        
        “No one can stop me!” he roared, lightning crackling around his cloak.<br><br>
        
        Streets disappeared. Parks turned to shadows. Hope was fading… until the people of Neo City did something brave.<br><br>

        They closed their eyes and imagined a hero — someone strong, bright, and kind. A superhero created by <b>you</b>.<br><br>
        
        What powers will they have? What do they look like? It's time to bring your superhero to life and save the city!
