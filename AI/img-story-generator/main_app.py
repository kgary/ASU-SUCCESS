Neo City once buzzed with joy, light, and floating buses ‚Äî until one day, Darkstorm returned.

From a swirling storm cloud, he emerged with a sneer, casting shadows that made entire buildings vanish. ‚ÄúNo one can save you now!‚Äù he boomed. Fear spread through every corner of the city.

But then... the people remembered something important: imagination is powerful. With hope in their hearts, they began to imagine a hero ‚Äî someone with brilliant powers, dazzling courage, and a heart full of kindness.

That hero is now taking form ‚Äî created by you ‚Äî ready to rise and bring the light back to Neo City.
