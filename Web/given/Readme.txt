In this first client-only version of Eliza, we use HTML, Javascript, and CSS (what is called the client-side "stack") 
to directly create an application in a Web browser. This example shows the basics of how a browser uses this stack
to present, style, and manipulate content without a web server.

This example also demonstrates basic artificial intelligence - or the appearance of intelligence - with the Eliza app.
Since the beginning of computer programming, we have wondered if computers wopuld ever become as intelligent as humans.
Some 60 years after Eliza, we have our answer today in Generative AI programs like ChatGPT. But are these programs "intelligent",
or merely give the appearance of intelligence? How do we even answer this question?

In 1950, a famous computer scientist Alan Turing (movie: "The Imitation Game") posed "the Turing Test" - where a person
is asked to interact with a computer program (Eliza) and a real person through a computer iterface, and if the person cannot
distinguish which responses come from the computer and which come from the human, then the computer program is "intelligent".
This ability to imitate a human is the origin of the movie title name!
