    <p>
      Eliza is a lab exercise I assign senior-level college students at ASU. Some concepts included here
      expose you to modern computing techniques (they may not make sense now but talk with someone you
      know in tech and see what they say, or email me if you have want to know more):
      <UL>
	<LI><i>Single-page Applications (SPAs)</i>: Eliza is an example of a SPA. In an SPA, you load one web file and interact with it. This is different than other types of webpages where you click on hyperlinks and go to a new page (you see the address in the location bar change). In industry, there are specialized technologies to assist with creating SPAs. Some mobile apps are really SPAs! Note that we do not have a server per se in this exercise.
	</LI>
	<LI><i>The HTML/Javascript/CSS stack</i>. Computer programs have grown in complexity in many ways. Nowadays it is not unusual to have one “program” written in many languages and technologies (the “stack”). In this exercise you have used HTML (markup for page structure and content) and Javascript (to exhibit behaviors). CSS, which we did not cover, focuses on formatting rendering to provide aesthetically pleasing (pretty) and responsive (the same web file can be displayed on different devices) web pages.
	</LI>
	<LI><i>Event-driven programming</i>. Traditionally computer programs are learned as a sequential set of instructions, where one line of code is executed then the next until the sequence of instructions is done. While there is a little bit of that here (like inside functions), you are using an event-driven model where code is executed in reaction to something else that has happened. A real-world example of this might be a Smart Home; when a smart home sensor like a motion detector detects motion, it can control other things like opening door locks, turning on lights, or adjusting the room temperature for comfort (check out IFTTT).
	</LI>
	<LI><i>Functional and object-oriented programming</i>. There are lots and lots of programming languages out there, with some good reasons for that (and some not so good). Programming languages are usually categorized by paradigm: functional, object-oriented, declarative, etc. Javascript is a bit of a hybrid; it is both object-oriented and functional, as you saw by working with certain object structures, like the DOM (document) and by having functions manipulate the DOM and handle events. This glosses over a fair amount of the distinction, but you have been exposed a little to both.
	</LI>
	<LI><i>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</i>: Much of AI nowadays is data-driven; using powerful mathematical algorithms to identify patterns in data and make decisions based on them. This Eliza is what is called GOFAI (Good old-fashioned AI), where models of human thinking are directly coded into programs. Further, Eliza and the Turing test started a still-ongoing philosophical and ethical debate about what constitutes intelligence; whether machines can become intelligent (or conscious, or just autonomous). You see this played in popular media with movies like The Terminator, The Matrix, and A.I. amongst others.
	</LI>
	<LI><i>Software Engineering</i>: Software engineering is another subdiscipline (like AI) focused
	  on applying the engineering design process to computer programming. There are some aspects of SE
	  here, including <i>incremental</i> problem solving, and <i>reverse engineering</i> - that is, for
	  you to enhance Eliza you need to understand how it works in the first place - essentially start from
	  a solution (the code I gave you), understand how it works, so you can then improve the solution.
