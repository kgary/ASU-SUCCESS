    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Since the early days of computing, humans wondered if computers could be made "intelligent".
      The father of modern day computing Alan Turing (movie: The Imitation Game) proposed
      <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank">the Turing test</a></i>,
      or the argument that if a computer could communicate like a human, then it possessed human intelligence.
      To demonstrate this philosophical approach,
      <a href="http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm" target="_blank">
	a computer program named ELIZA</a> was created to emulate
      <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/person-centered" target="_blank">
	a Rogerian psychological therapist</a> to a person by responding to queries. In essence,
        Eliza was ChatGPT before ChatGPT was!
    </p>
    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>
      For these activities we are giving you your own Eliza! The file <a href="eliza_local.html">eliza_local.html</a>
      has a self-contained Eliza program, no web server needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pro tip:</i> A software engineering principle is incremental problem solving; each of the
      numbered items under each Activity are independent, so “code a little test a little” by getting
      each one done and saving it. Then tackle the next step!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Another pro tip:</i> You are starting from a program I give you and modifying it to make it better.
      It is tempting to want to go straight to the code and understand it, but unless you are very
      experienced, you won't know where to start and it will be jibberish. Instead, run Eliza a few times
      and make an outline of the <i>algorithm</i> to so you understand the <i>process</i> first! This is
      another software engineering technique called <a href="./algorithm.html"><i>reverse engineering</i></a>.

    <UL>
      <LI><b>Activity 1</b>: Modify the HTML<br/>
	Let’s personalize your Eliza! Try some of the following:<br/>
	<OL>
	<LI>Change the greeting when the page first runs.</LI>
	<LI>Add a new paragraph using a p tag to have Eliza give a longer introduction to herself.
	  Consider using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp" target="_blank">
	    various formatting mechanisms</a> like you would in Google Docs.
	</LI>
	<LI>What does Eliza look like? Find a picture on the Internet and insert it in your Eliza welcome
	  message using the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp" target="_blank">
	  image tag</a>. 
	</LI>
        </OL>
    </UL>
    <UL>
      <LI><b>Activity 2</b>: Add some Javascript<br/>
	Let’s make your Eliza more intelligent by modifying what she knows. What she knows is stored in
	the <i>dict</i> variable at the bottom of the document.Try some of the following:<br/>
	<OL>
	<LI>For each existing key/phrases in the dictionary, add more keywords and more phrases</LI>
	<LI>Expand Eliza's vocabularly by adding new - keyword and phrase arrays (pairings)</LI>
	<LI>Can you think of ways to modify what Eliza says to make her sounds more <i>human</i></LI>
	<LI>(<i>Challenge!</i>) Have Eliza say something to restart the conversation if the user does
	  not type in a response in 20 seconds. To do this challenge, you need to use a new type of
	  <i>event</i> called a
	  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp" target="_blank">timer event</a>. 
	</LI>
        </OL>
    </UL>
    <UL>
      <LI>(Advanced) Add new features to Eliza!<br/>
	See if you can do the following:
	<OL>
	  <LI>If the user inputs just the word “quit” when talking to Eliza, reset the program
	    to the beginning (without re-loading the webpage).</LI>
	  <LI>Change to an ASU SUCCESS theme! Eliza has some pretty boring categories. Make an ASU-inspired theme
	    by changing Eliza to (these are just examples):
	    <UL>
	      <LI>Vecna – answers all things about the Upside Down</LI>
	      <LI>Your Dad – seems to be all-knowing about a significant number of things</LI>
	      <LI>Your Mom – expresses a lot of empathy for anything you say</LI>
	      <LI>Your Dog - just what is your puppy thinking?</LI>
	      <LI>A favorite movie character - Mine is Kevin from Despicable Me!</LI>
	    </UL>
	    Or whatever you want! Put images, phrasings, or anything  in-character (be nice!).
	    You can even make it a secret friend and you can see if you can get the friend to guess
	    who yours is!
	  </LI>
	  <LI>Make Eliza more intelligent. Can you think of ways to make Eliza more intelligent?
	    Yes Activity 2 does that in some ways, but what else can you think of? Keep in mind the
	    Turing test – the idea is to trick someone into believing your computer program is actually
	    a human! What kind of human traits can you inject that might trick the user into thinking
	    Eliza is ALIVE? Make a short (3 minutes or less) YouTube video of you running a Turing test
	    of your (modified) Eliza versus a human and see if you can trick your user!
	  </LI>
	</OL>
